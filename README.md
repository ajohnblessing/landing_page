## Project-Description
In this project, the navbar is built dynamically with Javascript as well as all the page interactivity.
If you click on an item on the navbar, it would scroll to the matching section of the page. While scrolling through the page, the sections are placed in their active states with their links too.


## Usage
If you wish to scroll to a certain section, click the link on the navbar e.g, to scroll to Section 5, click Section 5 on the navbar.

To view the active state of a section, scroll to the section and you will see that the navlink of that section is styled black and the section has received some active syles itself.
